Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- No. Because the number and the type of arguments passed of the two constructor are the same.
	+ To be more specific, only 1 arguments of type String is passed in the two constructor, 
	hence declaring both of them causes misunderstanding for the compiler.
