First of all, you should update the class diagram of AIMS according to the exercises in the lab.
For this lab class, you will have to turn in your work twice, specifically:
o Right after the class: for this deadline, you should include any work you have done within the lab
class.
o 10PM three days after the class: for this deadline, you should include the source code of all sections
of this lab, into a directory namely “Lab03” and push it to your master branch of the valid repository.
Each student is expected to turn in his or her own work and not give or receive unpermitted aid. Otherwise,
we would apply extreme methods for measurement to prevent cheating. Please note that you need
to write down answers for all questions into a text file and submit within the folder of the lab.
