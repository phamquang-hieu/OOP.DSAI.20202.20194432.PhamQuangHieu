● After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
- Because the method swap will create two different object in Heap memory and then coppy
the value of the two objects jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD into those object. Indeed, the
two newly created objects are swapped, not our original object.

● After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?

- Because the value contained in the jungleDVD variable is the address of the memory block
containing data about the jungleDVD object, when calling the function jungleDVD, the address
of the jungleDVD object is coppied to the variable dvd. That variable is also a reference 
to the jungleDVD object. Thus it can change the content of the memory block of the jungleDVD
via setter method.
